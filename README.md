# Diwali-Sales-Project-python:

Insights
Sales by Product Category:

The top 10 product categories contributed the highest sales during the Diwali festival. These include categories like electronics, fashion, and home decor, which experienced a significant surge in demand during the festive period.

Certain categories may have been more popular among specific age groups or demographics.

Sales by Marital Status:

Married customers made up a larger share of the sales, potentially due to purchasing gifts for family and loved ones during Diwali.

Single customers also exhibited a steady trend in sales, often purchasing items for personal use or gifting to friends.

Sales by Age Group:

Younger age groups (18-35) drove a significant portion of sales, with a preference for tech gadgets, clothing, and accessories.

Older age groups (36+) preferred home decor, kitchenware, and other utility products.

Gender-Based Sales:

Male customers showed higher sales in tech and electronics, while female customers had higher sales in fashion, accessories, and home decor.

Sales by State:

States with larger populations or higher purchasing power exhibited significantly higher sales. The top-performing states were often those with strong Diwali traditions and cultural importance.
